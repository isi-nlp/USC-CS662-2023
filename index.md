Monday and Wednesday 10:00â€“11:50 am, SOS B2

### Textbook
Required: [Natural Language Processing - Eisenstein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-natural-language-processing) ('E' in schedule)
-- or [free version](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)


Required: [Speech and Language Processing 3rd edition - Jurafsky, Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) ('JM' in schedule)
-- [January 2023 pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_jan72023.pdf)

Required: Selected papers from NLP literature, see (evolving) schedule

### Grading

10% - In class participation \
10% - Posted questions before each in-class selected paper presentation and possible quizzes \
10% - In-class selected paper presentation \
30% - Three Homeworks (10% each) \
40% - Project, comprising proposal (5%), first version of report (5%), in-class presentation (10%), and final report (20%). Done in small groups. \
Written homeworks and project components except for final project report must be submitted on the date listed in the schedule, by 23:59:59 [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html). \
Final project report is due Monday, December 11, 2022, 10:00 AM PST \
A deduction of 1/5 of the total possible score will be assessed for each late day. After five late days, you get a 0 on the assignment (and you should come talk to us because your grade will likely suffer!) \
You have four late days, to be applied as you wish, throughout the entire class, for homeworks and project proposal / first report (NOT final report). No deduction will be assessed if a late day is used.
